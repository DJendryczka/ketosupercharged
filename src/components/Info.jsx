      <p>
        The ketogenic diet, commonly referred to as the "keto diet," is a low
        carbohydrate, high fat diet that has become popular in recent years as a
        weight loss and health improvement strategy. The main idea behind the
        diet is to switch the body's primary source of energy from carbohydrates
        to fat. This shift is achieved by severely limiting the intake of
        carbohydrates and increasing the consumption of healthy fats, such as
        olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado. This causes the body to enter a
        state of ketosis, in which it starts to burn stored fat for fuel instead
        of glucose. In addition to weight loss, proponents of the keto diet
        claim it can improve a variety of health markers, such as reducing
        inflammation, improving brain function, and lowering the risk of chronic
        diseases. However, it's important to note that the long-term effects of
        the keto diet are still being studied and that it should be followed
        under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
